## Plugin Installation (dev)

Clone the plugin repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sop-IT/sop-voice.git
```

Move the plugin in NetBox application root:

> [!TIP]
> Application root is the `netbox/` folder with `dcim/` `ipam/`...

```bash
cd sop-voice
mv sop_phone /path/to/netbox/netbox
```

Upgrade NetBox

```bash
cd /path/to/netbox/
sudo bash upgrade.sh
```

## Add a new feature (dev)

Run a local Django server:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3 netbox/manage.py runserver --insecure
```

Each time you make a change, Django reloads the server.<br>
Do not forget to test your feature and to run unit-test to make sure you don't break any previous features. Refer to [**unit-test**](./unit-test.md).<br>
In order to deploy a new version of the plugin, refer to [**deploy**](./deploy.md).
